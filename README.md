The Portable release is just the program and nothing else
The Full release includes a setup program with options to configure DeskSearch
Setup source code can be found [here](https://github.com/miniusbhater/desksearchsetup)

Full release is highly recomended

Can work on windows 7 but it appears to be different from computer to computer
